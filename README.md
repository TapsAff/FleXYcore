# FleXYcore

### FleXYcore is a multi-functional rapid prototyping CoreXY platform integrating...
- FDM 3D Printing, for PLA and Nylon
- Laser Cutting, for PCB Tracing and MDF cutting
- CNC Milling, for PCB Milling

### The aim of this project is to...
- Design and build a platform that enables rapid prototyping of parts and PCBs.
- Enable the fabrication of production ready parts and PCBs for use in R&D products.
- Learn how to use an open-source approach and use github.
- Lead a technical project from concept to delivery, producing clear documentation and communication aids at every stage.
- Develop technical understanding of stepper motor control, reprap/repetier software, and improve my abilities to optimise mechanical design for cost and performance.

### Milestones...
- The project is starting 20th July
- CAD and BOM completed 31st July
- Get all axes moving 20th August
- 1 PLA Benchy printed 31st August
- 1 Test PCB substrate traced 10th September
- 1 Test PCB drilled and Milled 20th September
- 1 Nylon Benchy printed 30th Septmeber
- 1 Functional PCB fabricated 30th September

### The project will roughly be split into the following folders
- Itroduction to approach, project model/theory. (MAKE THIS A CHAPTER AND THEN USE IT TO EXPLAIN THE RATIONALE OF THE SETUP BELOW)
- Research, findings and rationale. Theory and Evidence.
- Target customer (ME!) written statement on how i work, what I need.
- Design Specification - why why why. Link to research, and target customer.
- Architecture Selection - why why why. Components and Software. Morphological Chart and Matrixes. Highlight the unkowns.
- The Design. Highlight design descisions not in selcetion document - what engineering methods are you thinking of? Mixture of design spec, Architecture, research.
- BOM and CAD.
- Software

The design folder, Bom and CAD, and software will all be updated on an on-going basis.
Git-Hub keeps a track of all changes yes, but it would be good to show in the doucment the evolution.
Each Milestone can have a document - this document can serve as a "lesson learnt" and "Changes and Evolution" Document clearly with pcitures and evidence, what apsect was not meeting the specification and how it was changed. This is also a chance to have "self-relfection"for every milestone to keep imporving the project. This document will reference changes to code, architecture, more research needed, updates to the specification, deisgn and bom changes etc. These will be "big boy"documents".
